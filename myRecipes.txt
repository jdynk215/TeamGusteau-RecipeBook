Caesar Salad_Classic Caesar Salad with romaine lettuce, homemade croutons, Parmesan cheese, and easy homemade Caesar dressing_1/2 cup high quality extra virgin olive oil#4 cloves fresh garlic, peeled, smashed, then minced#1 baguette, preferably a day old, sliced thin#1/4 cup freshly juiced lemon juice (plus more to taste)#4 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated#1 teaspoon anchovy paste, or 1-2 anchovies, smashed and minced#2 eggs#Freshly ground black pepper (1/4 teaspoon or to taste)#1/2 teaspoon salt#4-6 small heads of romaine lettuce, rinsed, patted dry, wilted outer leaves discarded_In a very large bowl, whisk together the olive oil and garlic. Let sit for half an hour.#Make the toasted croutons:While the oil is sitting, make the croutons. Spread the baguette slices out over a baking sheet (may need to do in batches), lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat.#Brush or spray with olive oil (or melted butter, or if you want garlicky croutons, dip pastry brush in the garlic infused oil you have sitting in step 1).#Broil for a couple of minutes until the tops are lightly browned. (Note: do not walk away, these can easily go from browned to burnt.) Remove and let cool.#Make the dressing:Add anchovies and eggs to the oil garlic mixture. Whisk until creamy. Add salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Whisk in half of the Parmesan cheese. Taste, add more lemon juice to taste. The lemon should give an edge to the dressing, but not overwhelm it.#Tear off chunks of romaine lettuce:Using your hands, tear off chunks of lettuce from the heads of romaine lettuce (do not use a knife to cut). Add to the oil mixture and toss until coated. Add the rest of the Parmesan cheese, toss.#Coarsely chop the toasted bread and add (with the crumbs from the chopping) to the salad.Toss. Serve immediately.
